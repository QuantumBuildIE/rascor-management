## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What are Toolbox Talks?

Toolbox Talks are short, focused safety training sessions that cover important health and safety topics relevant to your workplace. In construction and similar industries, these brief training sessions help keep safety at the forefront of everyone's mind.

In this system, Toolbox Talks are delivered digitally, allowing you to:
- Watch safety training videos
- Read educational content
- Take quizzes to test your understanding
- Sign off on completed training
- Keep a permanent record of your safety training

### 1.2 Why are They Important?

Toolbox Talks serve several critical purposes:

- **Safety Awareness**: Regular reminders about safe working practices help prevent accidents and injuries
- **Legal Compliance**: Many industries require documented safety training for all workers
- **Knowledge Retention**: Repeated exposure to safety information helps workers remember important procedures
- **Record Keeping**: Digital completion records provide proof of training for audits and inspections
- **Continuous Learning**: New hazards and best practices can be communicated quickly to all staff

### 1.3 Who Uses This System?

This system has two main types of users:

| User Type | What They Do |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Administrators** | Create and manage Toolbox Talks, assign them to employees, monitor completion progress, and generate reports |
